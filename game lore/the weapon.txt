The weapon that the protagonist is trying to retrieve the plans for is a highly advanced and sophisticated smart bomb.   

This smart bomb is designed to home in on the Overwatch Tower, bypassing all of the Combine's defenses and delivering a precise and devastating blow to the heart of the Combine's power in the city. 

The smart bomb is equipped with cutting-edge technology that allows it to avoid causing harm to the surrounding city and its inhabitants, 

making it the perfect tool for the resistance to use in their fight to reclaim City 14 from the Combine. 

The protagonist must use their cunning, strength, and bravery to overcome the many obstacles in their path and retrieve the plans for this weapon, 

which they hope will be the key to freeing the city from the grip of the Combine.
